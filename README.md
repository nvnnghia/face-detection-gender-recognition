Face detection and Gender recognition - My Undergraduate Project

In this project I learned to using diferent types of feature descriptors such as HOG, Gabor, Dense SIFT, LBP. Then I learned to use a classification method that is Support Vector Machine. 
First, I used features extraction to extract features from data base and Then I use SVM to train the data and do classification.

The purpose of this project is to get me familiar with the fields of Image Processing and computer science.


Using different kind of feature extraction (HOG, Gabor, Dense SIFT, LBP, etc) to get the useful features from images. Then use SVM to training the data.
